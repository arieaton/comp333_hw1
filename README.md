Purpose of code: The purpose of our code is to create a landing page for a fake music review site.
We use css, and html.
Contents of our directory: We have an index html file which dictates the structure of our main webpage. In addition, we have three other html files which function as secondary webpages. We have a css file called stylesheet.css. We also have images that we use in our sites in their own folder.
How to run: We have been running the code locally in our browsers.
